# find-kth-largest-value-in-bst

Difficulty: medium

  Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive
  integer k and returns the kth largest integer contained in the BST. 
  You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that
  k  is less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.Also, 
  for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as
  distinct values. In other words, the second largest value in a BST containing
  values {5, 7, 7}  will be 7 â€”not 5.Each BST node has an integer value, a
  left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid
  BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is 
  strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values
  of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
  BST nodes themselves or None / null.
